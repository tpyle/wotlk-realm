"""Build sql/13_bot_lore.sql - the lore chatter corpus for mod-botlore.

The corpus lives here rather than in SQL because it is prose: it needs to be
readable and editable. This script turns it into an idempotent SQL file.

Filters on a line are all "0 means any", and mod-botlore prefers the most
specific line that matches, so a Duskwood line beats a generic one in Duskwood
and a Hogger line beats both when Hogger dies.

Placeholders substituted at speak time: %zone %area %target %quest %item
%level %name. Text must stay under 255 characters and must not contain a
vertical bar (the direct Player::Say path skips the hyperlink validation the
chat opcode would have done).

-- Lore chatter corpus for mod-botlore
--
-- GENERATED by tools/gen_bot_lore.py - edit the corpus there, not here, then
-- re-run it and apply this file. ".botlore reload" picks up changes without a
-- restart.
--
-- Supersedes sql/07_bot_lore_text.sql, which created the same table with the
-- earlier, smaller corpus and without the PersonalityMask and QuestId columns.
--
-- Every filter column is "0 means any", and mod-botlore prefers the most
-- specific matching line, so a line written for one quest beats one written
-- for a zone, which beats a generic one.
--
-- PersonalityMask matches the archetype mod-botlore derives from the bot's
-- name (FNV-1a over the lowercased name, modulo the archetypes its class is
-- allowed): 0x01 devout, 0x02 grim, 0x04 scholar, 0x08 boastful, 0x10 wry,
-- 0x20 haunted, 0x40 savage, 0x80 sinister. It is stable for the life of the
-- character, so a given bot always has the same voice.
--
-- Channel: 0 say, 1 emote, 2 party, 3 guild. Emote bodies are blanked for the
-- opposite faction by the core, so emote lines carry atmosphere only.

-- Idempotent: safe to run more than once.
